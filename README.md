# grade-calc

calc ur grades bruh with localstorage and stuff

this i thought would take two days...inadvertently it turned into my biggest
code base and taught me to hate javascript and love vue.
to build,

````
git clone <this thing>
npm i parcel
parcel build index.html```

````

or just use it lol

check out an example of the core data structure @ core.json - this gets saved into local storage and read at each refresh of page, which is what allows this project to work. the data is then converted into objects with handy methods.

todo:
create a prediction mode

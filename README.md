# grade-calc

calc ur grades bruh with localstorage and stuff

this i thought would take two days...inadvertently it turned into my biggest
code base and taught me to hate javascript and love vue.
to build,

````
git clone <this thing>
npm i parcel
parcel build index.html```

````

or just use it lol
